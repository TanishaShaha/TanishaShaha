ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Prakriti** â€” a crop disease diagnosis app designed to help identify plant diseases using image-based analysis. Itâ€™s built using **Java**, **XML**, and integrates **EdgeViT-S**, **transformers**, and other advanced deep learning techniques for accurate classification. For now, it's using a **local database (SQLite)** for storing data.

ðŸŒ± Always exploring new technologies, curious ideas, and ways to turn them into meaningful real-world solutions.

ðŸ‘¯ I enjoy working on creative projects in **mobile** and **web development**, turning ideas into practical digital solutions.
