<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Tanisha Shaha</h1>

🔭 I’m currently working on **SoulScript** — a mobile app designed to help people reflect on their thoughts, track their moods, and gain personal insights. I’m building it with **Flutter** and **Firebase**, aiming to blend technology and well-being into a beautiful digital experience.

🌱 I’m currently learning **Flutter**, **Firebase**, and exploring more tools for web and mobile development.

👯 I’m passionate about building creative projects in **web development** and **mobile app development**. I love exploring new technologies like **Flutter**, **Firebase**, and more, and I enjoy turning ideas into real digital experiences.
