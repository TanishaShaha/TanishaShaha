ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **SoulScript** â€” a mobile app designed to help people reflect on their thoughts, track their moods, and gain personal insights. Iâ€™m building it with **Flutter** and **Firebase**, aiming to blend technology and well-being into a beautiful digital experience.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Flutter**, **Firebase**, and exploring more tools for web and mobile development.
